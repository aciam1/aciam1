# Andrea Ciamarra
### Hello and welcome to my profile!
I am Andrea Ciamarra, I am an Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision Researcher at [CNIT](https://www.cnit.it/en/) (National, Inter-University Consortium for Telecommunications), Florence Italy.

In 2019 I achieved my Masterâ€™s Degree with honors in Computer Engineering at the University of Florence, Italy. In 2020 I joined the Media Integration and Communication Center (MICC).

In 2024 I received the Ph.D degree in Information Engineering (Computer Engineering curricula) from the University of Florence. My research project focused on investigating relevant scene features to address varied vision tasks, particularly future scene understanding applied to autonomous driving and classification problems in deepfake detection. Therefore, I have addressed different forecasting tasks in the autonomous driving context, such as predicting segmentation, optical flow and depth in advance. Furthermore, I have dealt with image classification for deepfake detection.

I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at Mercatorum University, Rome, Italy, in 2024, focusing on Deepfake detection techniques for images and videos. 

I serve as a reviewer for several international conferences and journals in the fields of computer vision and multimedia.

Presently, I am working as AI and Computer Vision Researcher at CNIT Consortium. My research areas include deep learning, computer vision, multimedia forensics and security, and deepfake detection.
